# Management-of-a-City-Hall


To assist in the digitalization of processes in public institutions, I am implementing a management system for a city hall. The main challenge is managing citizen requests by public officials. To avoid queues for registering a business, changing identity documents, or registering a student ID, the administration has decided to implement an information system to manage these activities.
